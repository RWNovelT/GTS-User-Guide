   GTS User Manual
   ===============
   
   The Geospatial Tracking System (GTS) aims to provide organizations with visibility on work performed by field staff 
   in order to improve the efficiency and accountability of field activities.
   
   With little to no training of field staff, the GTS will enable organizations to understand where field 
   activities are conducted, when those activities were conducted, and for how long.
   
   The GTS mobile phone application automatically records, at regular intervals (e.g. every 2 minutes), the GPS 
   coordinates (tracks) with a timestamp and name of the person, or team, using the mobile phone application while 
   implementing a given field activity.
   
   The GTS Dashboard will enable focal points to configure and manage their GTS instances and to visualize the movements 
   of field teams on a map as well as to download the corresponding tracks for further analyses.
   
   The GTS enables organizations to validate that field teams adequately performed given field activities since organizations 
   will receive GPS positions covering whole workdays for each of their field teams, which can be used in conjunctions with 
   paper, excel, geo-tagged pictures, WhatsApp messages, SMS or ODK-Collect-type reporting.
