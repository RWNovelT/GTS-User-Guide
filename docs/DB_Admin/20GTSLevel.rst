GTS Level
#########
The GTS level is the highest level in the console.

.. note:: 
    This level is only displayed if the user has been granted dashboard access to more than one organization, otherwise 
    the administration console opens directly at the Organizational level.

Organizations that have been removed from the dashboard are not deleted from the database but rather hidden from view in the 
console. To view previously deleted organizations to which you had a dashboard account, Select the "show deleted" checkbox in
the upper right of the screen
